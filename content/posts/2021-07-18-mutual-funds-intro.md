### What are mutual funds?

Let me tell you this in lame simple words. There is a person who is professionally called Fund Manager. Suppose he has 1000 customers. These customers could be anyone, a student, a housewife, a business-man, a waiter or anyone.

Now he takes some amount of money from all of them every month. Say a student gives ‚Çπ500, housewife gives ‚Çπ1000, waiter gives ‚Çπ100, and so on. And collecting all of it, the Fund Manager has say ‚Çπ5,00,000 rupees. Now this manager would put this money into stock market.

### What is stock market?

It is a market where all the big companies of any country collect money from normal people and use them, and that money is counted in terms of shares. Example - say Reliance Industries has 1 share value of ‚Çπ1,000. Now this manager can buy 500 shares of Reliance. The key note here is you are not making the choice as to where all the money should go. The manager knows where to put the money so it grows at a fruitful rate.

### But what if Reliance goes down?

I understand keeping all your eggs in one basket could be a risky job. So how would you buy shares of multiple companies having prices worth ‚Çπ5,000~‚Çπ50,000 each with just ‚Çπ500? That is exactly where the idea of Index Mutual Fund comes in!

### What is an Index Mutual Fund?

In India, there are two stock markets - National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). India has more users in NSE and they have made a group of top 50 companies of India and call it Nifty 50. It comprises of Infosys, ICICI, Maruti, etc.

Now even though any 1 or say 10 companies out of these 50 are not performing well, the other 40 companies balance out the graph of the complete Nifty 50 and it eventually goes up in a long run. Talking about some statistics, here I show you the performance of Nifty 50 over past 5 years :

As you can see, even during initial pandemic lockdown in March 2020, the market went down and balanced back up again. On an average, you can expect a 15~17% return on your money every year from Nifty 50 market.

### How is it better than Bank Fixed Deposits?

Our India has an inflation rate of 8% which means every year, price of each item goes up by 8% of the existing price, and no bank in India gives more than 5% interest on FDs, so logically, you make a loss of 3% every year by giving your money in FDs. Give it a thought.

### How much money will I make?

Let us do some calculations. Say you are 20 years old now and decide to put ‚Çπ500 every month until you are 45 years of age (for 25 years). Here is the breakdown of the money :

	Monthly payment : ‚Çπ500
	Rate of return : 20%
	Number of years : 25
	Total money invested : ‚Çπ1,50,000
	Total money received : ‚Çπ43,13,354
	Profit you made : ‚Çπ41,63,354 üòá

And if you keep money invested for 1 more year, you will get ‚Çπ86,334 more on the above profit. Awesome, is it not? Now let us say you start doing this bit late and start investing at the age of 23 and do the same thing until you are 45, just 3 years difference right? Should not make a large chunk? Let us see :

	Monthly payment : ‚Çπ500
	Rate of return : 20%
	Number of years : 22
	Total money invested : ‚Çπ1,32,000
	Total money received : ‚Çπ23,65,277
	Profit you made : ‚Çπ22,33,277 üôÅ

Woah! You just lost almost 50% of your profit just because you started investing 36 months late. That is the power of time when money is compounding. If you got curious about this compound interest conecpt, I suggest you watch this video to know more about it -

Hope this made you think about how much important role time plays here, and how much you could loose just by not starting investing early!

### Okay, where should I invest?

I suggest you invest in [HDFC Nifty 50 Index Mutual Fund](https://www.hdfcfund.com/our-products/hdfc-index-fund-nifty-50-plan) which has given a minimum of 13% return in a year. It is run by the largest bank of India hence is trust-worthy. I invest my money in it.

### How exactly do I invest?

You will need a demat account. It is generated from an existing bank account and in a complete online process. Open it in notable names like Zerodha, Upstox or Paytm Money. You can find tons of YouTube videos about how to open a demat account.

I personally use Paytm money. I will write future articles on How to open monthly SIP if I feel the need. Stay tuned! Hope I added some value to your life. Keep investing! üòä
