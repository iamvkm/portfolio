I will list some popular apps and websites, which you may be using often everyday.
I will also explain what data they take from you, with or without your knowing.
You may be surprised.

## Facebook
These are the things Facebook knows about you:

1. When you log into your account: 

2. When you upload a photo: **Location** where you clicked the photo, **Date** when you took it, **Model** of your device which you used.

3. When you talk to someone: All contacts in your phonebook, your **Call logs**, your **SMS logs**, and a list of who you talk to the most.
